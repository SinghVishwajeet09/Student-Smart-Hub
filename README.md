Problem Statement Title	
Centralised Digital Platform for Comprehensive student activity record in HEIs
Description	
Background:
Despite increasing digitization in education, student achievements ranging from academic excellence to participation in curricular and extracurricular activities remain scattered across various departments or lost in paper-based records, in many colleges and universities. There is no centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including:
- Conferences and workshops attended
- Certifications earned
- Club activities and volunteering efforts
- Competitions and academic contests
- Leadership roles and internships
- Community services done

This gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge.

Description:
The above problem necessitates the development of a Smart Student Hub (Mobile + Web Application) that acts as a centralized student record and achievement management platform.

Key Features include:
- Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities.
- Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars.
- Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility.
- Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format.
- Analytics & Reporting: For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations.
- Integration Support: Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms.

Impact and Benefits:
- Empowers students with a verified, holistic digital profile.
- Facilitates career planning, placements, and scholarship/higher studies applications.
- Reduces administrative burden during audits and accreditations.
- Encourages participation in co-curricular activities by making achievements visible and valued.
- Promotes data-driven decision-making at the institutional level.

Expected Solution:
We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that can digitally catalogue and manage a student's academic and non-academic achievements throughout their time in college. The proposed protocol will:
- Build a verified, holistic student profile from Day 1
- Reduce paperwork and improve transparency
- Make students better prepared for placements, fellowships, or postgraduate admissions
- Empower faculty with real-time data for mentoring and tracking
- Align with the digital transformation goals of higher education institutions
- Enhance institutional efficiency during accreditation or policy audits

This will bridge the gap by offering an all-in-one solution that empowers students, simplifies faculty tasks, and modernizes institutional operations.
